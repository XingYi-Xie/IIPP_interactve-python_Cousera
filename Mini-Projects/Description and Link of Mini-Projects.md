## Brief Descritions and links for mini-projects
### Week 0 - Comments, strings, numbers, arithmetic operators, arithmetic expressions, variables

Mini­project # 0 — “We want... a shrubbery!”

This mini­project is optional. The code will print “We want... a shrubbery!” to the console. Its purpose is to learn how to submit and peer assess your Python mini­projects via Coursera.

my implementation: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_ZLKjr62Qc3_0.py

The code for this project is not save in the repo.

### Week 1 - Functions, indentation, remainders, modules, Boolean expressions, relational operators, conditional statements

Mini­project # 1 — Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)
In this mini-project, we will simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner. The result is just printed to the console.

### Week 2 - Event handlers, local variables, global variables, SimpleGui module, buttons, input fields

Mini­project # 2 — “Guess the number” game

The first player (computer) thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. 
You will interact with your program using an input field and several buttons. For this project, we will ignore the canvas and print the computer's responses in the console.

### Week 3 - Canvas, event-driven drawing, string operations, drawing operations, timers

Mini­project # 3 — Stopwatch: The Game

Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons.

### Week 4 - Lists, distance computations, reflections, keyboard events, positional control, velocity control, mutable vs. immutable data

Mini­project # 4 — Pong

In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The 2 players controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the both side of the screen. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
I added an additional feature: press space to pause the game.

### Week 5 - Mouse events, list methods, iteration and list comprehension, dictionaries, load and drawing images
Mini­project # 5 — Memory

Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns.
My code replace the 16 * 1 numbers of cards with 4 * 4 images.

### Week 6 - Object-oriented programming, class fields and methods, tiled images
Mini­project # 6 — Blackjack

Blackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos. Cards in Blackjack have the following values: an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards (kings, queens and jacks) are valued at 10 and the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number. During a round of Blackjack, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a hand (a collection of cards) whose cards have a total value that is higher than the value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21.  (A round of Blackjack is also sometimes referred to as a hand.)
The game logic for our simplified version of Blackjack is as follows. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially with one of the dealer's cards being dealt faced down (his hole card). The player may then ask for the dealer to repeatedly "hit" his hand by dealing him another card. If, at any point, the value of the player's hand exceeds 21, the player is "busted" and loses immediately. At any point prior to busting, the player may "stand" and the dealer will then hit his hand until the value of his hand is 17 or more. (For the dealer, aces count as 11 unless it causes the dealer's hand to bust). If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player and dealer then compare the values of their hands and the hand with the higher value wins. The dealer wins ties in our version.
